You may update the model run in SWAT+ editor by replacing the files in this directory. Please note the following:

1. File names must be exactly the same, OR
2. Update the version number in the appsettings.json file in the directory above this one. If the version number in that file is updated, the SWAT+ exe file names must match accordingly.

Want to run the model outside of SWAT+ Editor? Copy the appropriate executable file from this folder and paste it into your input files directory (e.g., c:\my-project\Scenarios\Default\TxtInOut). It is best to run the executable from the command line / terminal.
