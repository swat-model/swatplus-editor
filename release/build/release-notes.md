* Release 2.3.0.
* We recommend users please visit the SWAT+ website to update your QSWAT+ version
* SWAT+ model updated to revision 60.5.7; see model revision notes for input/output changes
* swatplus_datasets.sqlite updated to version 2.3
* Due to the change to plants.plt, if you're updating an existing project, consider reloading your plants database with the new data through the interface. Download the plants CSV file from plus.swat.tamu.edu (browse to version 2.3), and from SWAT+ Editor go to Edit -> Databases -> Plants, click the Import button, then select the Import tab and downloaded CSV file.
* Added basic interface for building water allocation tables. Water allocation tables are very specific to the watershed and new feature in SWAT+. We recommend working with the model development team if you are unsure. Because this is a new addition, the interface is still limited if you're trying to build a large table with many source and demand objects.
* Bug fix in SWAT+ Check - urban codes now displayed in the Land Use Summary section
