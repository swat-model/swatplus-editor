### SWAT+ Editor v3.0.10 ###

* When converting SWAT2012 weather files to SWAT+, change temperature extension from .tmp to .tem because Windows auto-deletes .tmp files
* Fix a bug where pages wouldn't load for Connections -> Reservoirs -> Reservoir Hydrology and Wetland Hydrology
* Update read_output.py to check for asterisks and too long of number in the gis_id column

_No breaking changes from v3.0.0 and later._
